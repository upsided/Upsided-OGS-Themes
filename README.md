# Upsided-OGS-Themes
 
These are [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) themes for [online-go.com](https://online-go.com), similar to my [Sabaki Themes](https://github.com/upsided/upsided-sabaki-themes/).

Currently I only have the [Hikaru Theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upsided/Upsided-OGS-Themes/main/ogs-hikaru/ogs-hikaru.user.js) as I try to work out graphical clipping issues with the others. Enjoy!

## Installation

1. You need to be signed in to your OGS account for these to work properly (sry)
2. Install [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) into your web browser (GreaseMonkey/ViolentMonkey untested, but might work)
3. Click the user.js script you want below, e.g. [OGS-Hikaru](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upsided/Upsided-OGS-Themes/main/ogs-hikaru/ogs-hikaru.user.js)
4. TamperMonkey should appear, and show the script.
5. Click the Install button.
6. Visit OGS. Enjoy!

You can only use one theme at a time, so make sure you disable the others using the TamperMoneky menu.
