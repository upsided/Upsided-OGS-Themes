# Upsided-OGS-Themes
 
These are [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) themes for OGS, similar to my [Sabaki Themes](https://github.com/upsided/upsided-sabaki-themes/)

Currently I only have the [Hikaru Theme](https://github.com/upsided/upsided-ogs-themes/ogs-hikaru/ogs-hikaru.user.js) as I try to work out graphical clipping issues with the others. Enjoy!

To use, you need the TamperMonkey installed in your web browser. This allows the script to change the OGS display on the fly.

To install, TBD...
