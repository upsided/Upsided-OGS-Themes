# Upsided-OGS-Themes
 
These are [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) themes for [online-go.com](https://online-go.com), similar to my [Sabaki Themes](https://github.com/upsided/upsided-sabaki-themes/).

Currently I only have the Hikaru theme as I try to work out graphical clipping issues with the others.

## Installation

1. Sign into your OGS account (you need an account for script to work, sry)
2. Install [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) into your web browser (GreaseMonkey/ViolentMonkey untested, but might work)
3. Click the user.js script you want below.
4. TamperMonkey should appear, and show the script code.
5. Click TamperMonkey's Install button to install the script.
6. Visit OGS. Enjoy!

You can only use one theme at a time, so make sure you disable the others using the TamperMoneky menu.

## Editing
The scripts are designed for easy modding. Have fun!

1. Open up a user script using menu **TamperMonkey->scriptname->edit**
2. Select all of the script & copy
3. Create a new script using **TamperMonkey->Create New Script...**
4. Paste
5. IMPORTANT: Change this line at top to name your script so Tampermonky can tell the difference:
```
// @name         ogs hikaru // <-- change this to the name of your new script
```

6. Save & Edit!


## Downloads
>Note: clicking a link will show the TamperMonkey install window if you have TamperMonkey enabled.
